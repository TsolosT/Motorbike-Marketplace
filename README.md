# MotorBike Marketplace App üèçÔ∏è

A feature-rich React application that allows users to buy, sell, and rent motorbikes. Built using Vite, Firebase, Swiper, and Leaflet, this app enables users to explore available motorbikes, view details and locations, and easily contact sellers or renters.

> This project is a **study case** from the Udemy course [React Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/) by Brad Traversy. It was built to practice React, modern JavaScript, Firebase & API interaction.

## Live Preview
